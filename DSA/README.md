# Competitive Programming

Competitive Programming it is a mind sport with which you compete with individuals from all over the world. It is a great way to showcase your problem-solving skills, which is certainly something a lot of companies look for.

# How to begin with Competitive Programming

 ### Learn a Programming Language ###
 It is highly recommended that you choose one of C/C++ or Java.The reason being  C/C++ and Java are relatively faster, particularly when compared to languages like Python. Pick any 1 language and spend a good time understanding the basic concepts of it.You can use [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for tutorials.
 
 ### Starting with Competitive Programming
 
 Start practising on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).It has a great IDE and a wonderful beginners program which will help you in getting started. Hackerrank has a great set of problems whose difficulty increases gradually and hence you will not face a sudden rise or fall of difficulty

### Get Familiar with Data Structures and Algorithms

Your score of a question revolves around your algorithms and data structure.At beginners stage, you should first cover :
* calculating best,average and worst case complexity of code
* Basic searching algorithms like linear and binary search
* Sorting techniques : Bubble sort,Selection Sort and insertion sort


### Starting with actual online competitions

Once you are familiar with time complexities, I/O operations of online IDE’s and the above algorithms you can start with actual competitions for which the following sites provide the best environment for competing with others:

*  [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/): Its a problem archieve and is recommended for all beginners.Start with problems having maximum submissions. Solve first few problems (may be 20). Build some confidence and then start solving problem topicwise.Try to solve atleast  100 most solved problems on SPOJ, problem by problem.This will teach all standard problems, algorithms and implementation skills. After this you can go for Codechef,Codeforces and topcoder.

* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com): offers 3 monthly contests:
->Long Challenge: This is a 10-day long contest and is one of the best contest to start Competitive Programming with as it does not have any wrong answer penalty and gives you a lot of time to think and implement your solution for a particular problem.
->Cook-Off: This is a much shorter contest that lasts for 2.5 hours and features 5 problems of varying difficulty, this contest will teach you how to think and implement a solution within a given time constraint
->Lunch Time: This is a 3-hour contest meant for school students. A Lunchtime usually features 4 problems.

* [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/): 4 to 5 short contests of 2 hour in a month .

* [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/): contains one of the best editorials and tutorials . It’s one of the largest crowdsourcing community of developers where one can try things related to competitive programming, designs, data science, etc.

### The Final Step: Practice,Practice and Practice

# Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA)

After covering above mentioned algorithms, you should learn the rest of DSA in following order:
* Stack,Queue,linked list
* Algorithms of Dynamic programming.Divide And conquer,greedy method,backtracking
* Binary Tree,AVL tree,Hashing

# Some Special Contests

*  [Google Codejam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam): The competition happens annually. The top 25 contestants for the World Finals Round are brought onsite, and the winner gets a prize money of 15,000$. The top finishers are usually reached out for a potential job opportunity.
*  [FaceBook Hackercup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/): The winner gets a prize money of 10,000$. Just as with CodeJam, the top finishers are reached out for a potential job opportunity. 
*  [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/): It is like the olympics of CP. Universities world over host online and regional onsite competitions, and the winners from these advance to the World Finals.

Keep Learning.
